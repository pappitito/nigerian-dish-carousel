            <p id="about">Nkwobi is a Nigerian dish made from spiced cow foot.
                 It's served in posh restaurants and beer bars in Nigeria. Nigerians 
                 love it. The only problem is that cowfeet take a long time to boil. 
                 Slow cookers or pressure cookers are good since they cook food more slowly. 
                 If neither option was available, I found that boiling and freezing cowfeet 
                 was a great substitute. My freezer always has ready-to-eat meats. This 
                 reduces my kitchen time.</p>
